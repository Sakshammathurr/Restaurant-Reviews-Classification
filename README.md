Classified restaurant reviews using XG boost and Naive Bayes 


XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) and Naive Bayes are two popular machine learning algorithms used for classification tasks, including sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews.

XGBoost and Naive Bayes are two powerful algorithms for restaurant review classification, and their effectiveness depends on the quality of the data and the preprocessing techniques used.

XGBoost is a powerful algorithm that utilizes gradient boosting to iteratively train weak models and combine them into a strong model. It is particularly effective for classification tasks and has been used to win many data science competitions. In the context of restaurant reviews, XGBoost can be used to classify each review as positive or negative based on its features, such as the words used, the tone of the language, and the overall sentiment expressed.

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm that uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of each class given the features of the input data. It is a simple yet effective algorithm for classification tasks, particularly for text classification. Naive Bayes assumes that the features are independent of each other, which is not always the case in real-world scenarios. However, despite this simplifying assumption, Naive Bayes often performs well in practice.
